        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 130%; width: 1000px; margin: auto;">Welcome to EchoSanctuary, 
            a safe space where silenced youth can reclaim their voices. 
            Many children and teens grow up in homes where they are mistreated, abused, or ignored. 
            This program is dedicated to breaking that silence, spreading awareness, and creating a 
            community of support.</p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Background of the Problem</h1>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Many young people grow up in environments where they feel invisible, silenced, or neglected. 
        These experiences can leave deep scars, affecting their confidence, self-expression, and 
        mental well-being. Abuse is not always physical, sometimes it comes in the form of words 
        unspoken, affection withheld, or being ignored in a house full of people. The silence can be 
        just as painful as open wounds, leaving children without a voice to speak their truth.

        Statistics show that youth mental health concerns are rising, with neglect and emotional mistreatment 
        being common yet overlooked contributors. Families, schools, and communities often fail to recognize the 
        silent struggles of children who suffer quietly. Without safe spaces and support, many carry these unspoken 
        burdens into adulthood. 

        <br><br><br>
    
        Currently, schools, non-profits, and mental health organizations are working to raise awareness about child 
        abuse and neglect. Campaigns highlight the importance of recognizing not just physical violence, but also 
        the silent emotional harm that youth endure. Hotlines, counseling centers, and awareness drives exist to 
        provide initial help and comfort for those in need.

        However, many young people remain unheard because stigma and fear hold them back. Resources may exist, but 
        accessibility is limited, and safe spaces tailored specifically for silenced youth are rare. This is where
         our advocacy comes in.</p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Where we Come in</h1>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        EchoSanctuary steps in as more than just an advocacy, it is a sanctuary built for the silenced. While 
        existing programs focus on general mental health or abuse prevention, many young people still slip through 
        the cracks, especially those who are not physically abused but grow up feeling invisible in their own homes. 
        EchoSanctuary recognizes that silence itself can wound, and it exists to give those young people a voice.

        Here, youth are encouraged to share their stories in ways that feel safe for them, through words, 
        art, or simply by connecting with others who understand their struggles. By providing a space free from 
        judgment, EchoSanctuary helps young people transform their pain into resilience and their silence into strength.
            <br><br><br>

        EchoSanctuary also bridges awareness and action. It doesn’t just highlight the problem; it offers pathways 
        to support, from connections to mental health resources to peer-driven encouragement. Every story told here 
        contributes to spreading awareness, and inspiring others to seek help.

        Most importantly, EchoSanctuary reminds every child and teen that they are not alone. Even in the quietest 
        of struggles, there is a community ready to listen, to echo their voices back to them, and to assure them 
        that their presence matters.
